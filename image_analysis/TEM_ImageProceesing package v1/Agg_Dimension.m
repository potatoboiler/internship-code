function [ A_length, A_width ] = Agg_Dimension(mainfolder,Im_Dir,Final_Edge,FileName,pixsize,particle_number )
%Aggregate_Dimension etermines the length & width of the agglomerate, and
%provides a rotated image of the particle with length and width axis
%   Based on function_length_width3 (Arka and Hugo) with memory saving improvement
%   ---LENGTH---
%   ---ALGORITHM---
%   Given the agglomerate's fourth edge image, E4, the algorithm finds the 
%   y and x indices of the white pixels (value = 1) in the arrays of ROW and 
%   COL, respectively. Then, it computes the euclidean distance between every 
%   single white pixel with reference to every other white pixel, and
%   selects the greatest distance, which yields the length of the
%   agglomerate.  It is important to note that for speed, the distances are
%   computed in a vectorized form, such that each 'DISTANCE' array represents
%   the distances of the considered white pixel with reference to all other
%   pixels.  The maximum of the 'DISTANCE' array is chosen as the
%   'greatest_distance', and then compared to the length.  Once the length is
%   found, the position of the two pixels is recorded via x1_l_bot, etc...
%
%   ---WIDTH---
%   ---ALGORITHM---
%   this algorithm calculates the width by rotating the image by 'theta' degrees
%   counterclockwise, until the length axis is parallel with the y-axis.
%   Then the width corresponds to the location of the greatest x indices of a
%   white pixel minus the location of the smallest x indices of a white pixel.

%% Lenght Calculation

% to compute the length in vector form, and record the position of the two
% pixels that specify the length.  Since the 'find' function searches
% column-by-column, in the order of increasing x, then increasing y, the
% pixel specified by 'pos1' will always have a greater y-indices than the
% pixel specified by pos2.  This helps determine theta, later on in the
% program.

for pos1 = 1:1:area_edge_particle
    DISTANCE = ( (COL1 - COL1(pos1)).^2 + (ROW1 - ROW1(pos1)).^2 ).^.5;

        length = greatest_distance;
        x1_l_bot = COL1(pos1);
        y1_l_bot = ROW1(pos1);
        x2_l_top = COL1(pos2);
        y2_l_top = ROW1(pos2);
    end

%% Width Calculation

% to mark the pixels that specify the length.  It is important to note that
% an error may arise during the rotation of the image, because some pixels
% are obscured, or even deleted via the rotation process.  In order to
% prevent this, the pixel left-adjacent to the true length-defining pixels
% are also marked with a value of '2', or '3'.

Temp_Final_Edge (y2_l_top, x2_l_top) = 3;
Temp_Final_Edge (y2_l_top, x2_l_top+1) = 3;

% to determine theta, the problem becomes a system of 2 equations with 2
% unknown, with 2 differing situations.

    theta = 0;
end

end
if x1_l_bot > x2_l_top
    theta = abs (180 - (atan( (x1_l_bot - x2_l_top) / (y1_l_bot - y2_l_top) ) * 180 / pi));

%% PLOT LENGTH AND WIDTH AXIS ALONG ROT
% ---ALGORITHM---
% To draw the perpendicular length axis, the indices of the length-defining
% pixels are needed.  These are located by finding the pixels that were 
% originally marked with values of '2' and '3'.  However, due to the fact 
% that during rotation, some pixels are lost, it may be better to find the
% maximum and minimum y values instead.
